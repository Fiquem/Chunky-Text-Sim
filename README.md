# Menu Screen Test

I have a computer that can  compile things now. No excuses now.

Well, I have literally no ideas.

Alright, IDEAS

## Ideas
Make a sort of Assassin's Creed like move-y triangle background foir a menu screen

### PLAN:
- make a cube and put it on the screen to test lighting DONE
- generate like 20x20 points in rows/columns but with like a little random offset in every direction DONE
- slap it on the screen DONE
- how the fuuuuuuuuuuck do I format a .mdddddd DONE

## Things I installed to run stuff
- MinGW/MSYS (need msys for proper make)
- uh I feel like there was something else but I'm drawing a balnd
