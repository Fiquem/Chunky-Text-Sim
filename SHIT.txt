Shit I had issues with:
-----------------------
1. couldn't find glfw3.dll (when I added in glfwinit, program no longer printed) FIXED
	- had to move dlls to main folder. dunno why just pointing them at libs didn't work...

2. make clean doesn't work FIXED
	- because rm isn't in mingw, neither is make but instead it has its own make which is why I had to alias that I guess???
	- gonna install msys and see what happens
	- lol yeah installed msys and set path variable to its bin and we good fam we good
