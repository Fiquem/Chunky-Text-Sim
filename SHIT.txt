Shit I had issues with:
-----------------------
1. couldn't find glfw3.dll (when I added in glfwinit, program no longer printed) FIXED
	- had to move dlls to main folder. dunno why just pointing them at libs didn't work...

2. make clean doesn't work FIXED
	- because rm isn't in mingw, neither is make but instead it has its own make which is why I had to alias that I guess???
	- gonna install msys and see what happens
	- lol yeah installed msys and set path variable to its bin and we good fam we good

3. this one is just a shoutout to me for figuring out how to alter a makefile to include headers with the c files you know what I'm tlaking about
	- why do I see projects with .o files?
	- I'm just compiling all the .c ones
	- should I be making .os somewhere???
	- FIXED no I no need no .o ;o

4. I pushed a commit while github is down and now I don't know how to push that commit D: FIXED
	- pushing this change fixed it WEIRD

5. weird glew errors like _imp________glewSomething undefined reference or some bull FIXED
	- FUXKING GLEW WAS FOR FUCKING VS
	- downloaded and compiled glew myself
	- worked even though there were a bunch of errors! didn't realise that and spent way too long looking for another way to fix this!! that's really annoying, glew!!!

6. what is he doing with his fucking shader thing I thought this was cool FIXED
	- but he;s using old shader code with attributes or varyiung or some shit?
	- WHY
	- is half this shader code even necessary?
	- xan I update this?
	- I@M AN IDIOT this all makes sense iugnore moe
	- me

7. shader compiler errors that mean I put in Anotn's error message stuff and it's complaining about repeated definitions? FIXED
	- is the string for shaders not clearning itself or smth?>
	- ... I guess that's what shader_string[0] = '\0'; is for eh
	- I also go tlinker errors but that was me bieng dumb GL_COMPILE_STATUS instead of GL_LINK_STATUS in linker status thingy

8. gotta make a nice mesh struct like shader struct because god damn it's too neat not to DONE
	- I don't have a clue what this boy is doing in mesh.c where are his vbos
	- I don't need those? why have I been using those?
	- what even is graphics
	- oh just different data format than I'm used to?
	- I cab;t find my triables
	- I stole a cubemap cube is why so all my triangles are facing the wrong way oops
	- still can't find it
	- HOLYU FUCKJ I FOUYND IT
	- dumb thing that I did: order of drawing things and clearing things and swapping frame buffer. what I had: clear, swap, draw (see the issue?). order that I need: clear, draw, swap.
	- I'm so mucb dumb.,

9. Why is it crashing this time: a plane story FIXED
	- commenting out the loading the tex coords stuff fixed it? even though I'm doing the exact same thing with the cube??
	- WHO KNOWS

10. Why is my plane FIXED
	- 1: far wider than it should be
	- 2@ lying on the wrong axis
	- I am dumb this is not an issue

11. Gotta claculate normals oh jesus DONEZO
	- did it wrong first
	- but then I did it right
	- (was getting the cross product of points instead of vectors oh dear)

12. Occurred to me that I could be doing stuff like this in shaders, but is there a way to get previous/next point for normal calc?

13. Why is my plane displacement thing only working on some of the rows?? FIXED
	- I did maths wrong

15. WHY STILL CRASHING FIXEDO?
	- out of memory?
	- it's in the plane loading bit somewhere, commenting that (in draw loop) fixes it
	- deleted stuff and fixed mb? we'll see

16. fog or summat? DONE
	- fog ye
	- done ye stole from here and Anton told me to clamp tyty
	- http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fog/fog.htm



14. Sooooo I kinda did the thing I meant to do, which is like a background for a menu, so I guess expand this into a menu?
	- not yet, it's still crashing
	- put text on screen?

17. BLUER
	- blur, it's blue enough
